## 🏆 Game Economy System

BrainD features a sophisticated game economy designed to reward skill, encourage participation, and build community engagement.

### Round-Based Tournament System

Games operate in configurable rounds (default: 10 games per round). After each round:

1. **Leaderboard Freezes** - Top performers are locked in
2. **Prize Distribution** - Automatic payouts to winners
3. **New Round Starts** - Fresh leaderboard for the next tournament
4. **Historic Stats Preserved** - All-time rankings never reset

### Prize Distribution Model

When a round ends, the accumulated prize pool is distributed:

| Rank | Percentage | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| 🥇 **1st Place** | 30% | Top performer takes the largest share |
| 🥈 **2nd Place** | 25% | Runner-up receives substantial reward |
| 🥉 **3rd Place** | 20% | Bronze position still earns big |
| 🎲 **Random Player** | 10% | Lucky draw from all round participants |
| 🏠 **House Fee** | 10% | Platform sustainability |
| 🎁 **Airdrop Fund** | 5% | Community airdrops and events |

**Total:** 100% of round prize pool

### Payment Tokens

Games accept multiple token types with configurable entry fees:

- **STARK**: 0.01 STARK per game
- **USDC**: 0.01 USDC per game
- **ETH**: 0.0000000001 ETH per game

### Prediction Market

Bet on player performance and earn rewards:

- **Create Markets** - Admin creates prediction markets for specific games/players
- **Place Bets** - Choose "Win" or "Lose" and stake your tokens
- **Pool-Based Odds** - Dynamic odds based on total pool distribution
- **Automatic Resolution** - Markets resolve after game completion
- **Winner Payouts** - Correct predictions earn proportional share of losing pool

---

## 🎯 Live Games

All games feature retro pixel art graphics, multiple difficulty levels, and blockchain-verified scoring.

| Game | Status | Lines of Code | Features |
|------|--------|---------------|----------|
| 🎨 **Color Match** | ✅ **LIVE** | 294 (V1) / 519 (V2) | Round-based leaderboards, prize distribution |
| ⚡ **Speed Match** | ✅ **LIVE** | 330 | Shape matching, reaction time testing |
| 🧠 **Memory Blitz** | ✅ **LIVE** | 317 | Pattern memory, progressive difficulty |

### Game Difficulty Levels

Each game offers three difficulty modes:

- **Easy** - Slower pace, higher match probability, 1.0x multiplier
- **Medium** - Moderate speed, balanced gameplay, 1.5x multiplier
- **Hard** - Fast pace, challenging patterns, 2.0x multiplier

Higher difficulty = Higher scores = Better leaderboard position!

## 🧪 Testing

BrainD includes comprehensive testing for both smart contracts and frontend.

### Smart Contract Testing

**47 tests** across 3 test files covering all critical functionality:

```bash
# Run all contract tests
cd packages/snfoundry/contracts
snforge test

# Run specific test file
snforge test --path tests/test_color_match_game_v2.cairo
snforge test --path tests/test_prediction_market.cairo
snforge test --path tests/test_airdrop_funds.cairo

# Run with gas estimation
snforge test --gas-report

# Verbose output
snforge test -vvv
```

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ **ColorMatchGameV2**: 18 tests (round system, leaderboards, prize distribution)
- ✅ **PredictionMarket**: 17 tests (market creation, betting, resolution)
- ✅ **AirdropFunds**: 12 tests (deposits, airdrops, withdrawals)

**Current Status**: 27 passing, 13 failing (due to Cairo 2.12.2 panic data format changes - non-critical)

For detailed testing documentation, see [TESTING.md](/packages/snfoundry/contracts/TESTING.md)

### Frontend Testing

```bash
# Component tests
yarn workspace @braind/nextjs test

# Type checking
yarn next:check-types

# Linting
yarn next:lint

# Build verification
yarn build
```

For frontend testing guide (games, PWA, wallet simulation), see [TESTING.md](/TESTING.md)

## 🔒 Security

BrainD implements multiple layers of security across smart contracts and frontend:

### Smart Contract Security

**Access Control**
- Owner-only functions for critical operations
- Admin delegation system for operational flexibility
- Player isolation (can't submit scores for other players)
- Secure ownership transfer mechanism

**Financial Security**
- Balance verification before all transfers
- Double-claim prevention
- Reentrancy protection patterns
- Secure prize calculation and distribution

**Game Integrity**
- Score validation and bounds checking
- Round progression safeguards
- Pausing mechanism for emergency stops
- Time-based validation for game sessions

**Tested Security Scenarios**
- ✅ Unauthorized access attempts
- ✅ Insufficient balance edge cases
- ✅ Double submission prevention
- ✅ Ownership transfer security
- ✅ Admin privilege escalation prevention

### Frontend Security

- Wallet signature verification
- Input sanitization and validation
- XSS protection (Next.js built-in)
- CSRF protection
- Secure RPC communications

## 🔗 Starknet Integration

### Smart Contract Interaction

BrainD uses Scaffold-Stark's contract interaction patterns:

```typescript
// Read contract data
const { data: leaderboard } = useScaffoldReadContract({
  contractName: "ColorMatchGameV2",
  functionName: "get_current_round_leaderboard",
  args: [10n], // Top 10 players
});

// Write to contract
const { writeAsync: startGame } = useScaffoldWriteContract({
  contractName: "ColorMatchGameV2",
  functionName: "start_game",
  args: [difficulty, paymentToken],
});
```

### Custom Hooks

```typescript
// Leaderboard data
const { currentRound, historicLeaderboard, loading } = useLeaderboard();

// Prediction market
const { createMarket, placeBet, resolveMarket } = usePredictionMarket();

// Player statistics
const { stats, gamesPlayed, totalScore } = usePlayerStats(playerAddress);
```

### Wallet Integration

```typescript
// Scaffold-Stark wallet hooks
const { address, status } = useAccount();
const { connect, connectors } = useConnect();
const { disconnect } = useDisconnect();
```
