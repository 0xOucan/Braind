# 🧠 Memory Blitz - Example Game Implementation

Memory Blitz is a classic memory training game where players must remember and reproduce sequences of colored tiles. This serves as a complete example implementation for the BrainD platform.

## 🎯 Game Overview

**Cognitive Skill**: Memory & Recall
**Difficulty Levels**: Easy (4 tiles) → Medium (6 tiles) → Hard (8 tiles)
**Reward Range**: 25-80 $STARK tokens
**Game Type**: Sequence Memory

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Watch**: A sequence of colored tiles lights up
2. **Remember**: Memorize the order and pattern
3. **Reproduce**: Click the tiles in the same sequence
4. **Progress**: Complete sequences to advance levels
5. **Score**: Earn points based on accuracy and speed

## 🔧 Key Components

### GameBoard.tsx
Main game component that orchestrates the entire game experience:
- Manages game state and progression
- Handles user interactions
- Integrates with BrainD platform hooks
- Displays game board and UI elements

### MemoryTile.tsx
Individual tile component:
- Animated tile states (idle, active, correct, wrong)
- Pixel art styling with retro effects
- Click handling and visual feedback
- Accessibility support

### GameUI.tsx
Game interface elements:
- Score display with pixel font styling
- Timer with countdown animation
- Level progression indicator
- Game controls (start, pause, reset)

## 🧠 Game Logic

### Sequence Generation
```typescript
// Generate random sequence based on difficulty
const generateSequence = (length: number): number[] => {
  return Array.from({ length }, () => Math.floor(Math.random() * 4));
};
```

### Scoring Algorithm
```typescript
// Score calculation: base points + time bonus + streak bonus
const calculateScore = (level: number, timeRemaining: number, streak: number): number => {
  const baseScore = level * 10;
  const timeBonus = Math.floor(timeRemaining / 1000) * 2;
  const streakBonus = streak * 5;
  return baseScore + timeBonus + streakBonus;
};
```

### Difficulty Progression
- **Easy**: 4 tiles, 3 seconds display, 10 levels
- **Medium**: 6 tiles, 2.5 seconds display, 15 levels
- **Hard**: 8 tiles, 2 seconds display, 20 levels

## 🎨 Visual Design

### Color Scheme
```css
:root {
  --tile-blue: #3b82f6;
  --tile-red: #ef4444;
  --tile-green: #10b981;
  --tile-yellow: #f59e0b;
  --tile-inactive: #374151;
  --tile-glow: rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.5);
}
```

### Animations
- **Tile Activation**: Smooth glow effect with color transition
- **Sequence Display**: Staggered tile lighting with timing
- **User Feedback**: Success/error states with visual feedback
- **Level Progression**: Satisfying completion animations

### Responsive Layout
- Desktop: 4x2 grid layout with large tiles
- Tablet: 2x4 grid with medium tiles
- Mobile: 2x2 stacked grid with touch-optimized tiles

## 🔌 Platform Integration

### BrainD Session Management
```typescript
import { useGameSession } from '~/hooks/scaffold-stark';

const {
  currentSession,
  startGame,
  submitScore,
  endGame
} = useGameSession();

// Start session
const handleStartGame = () => {
  startGame('memory_blitz', difficulty);
};

// Submit final score
const handleGameEnd = async (finalScore: number) => {
  await submitScore(finalScore);
  endGame();
};
```

### Starknet Contract Integration
```typescript
// Automatic score submission to blockchain
const submitToContract = async (score: number, level: number) => {
  const result = await submitGameScore({
    args: ['memory_blitz', score, difficulty, duration]
  });
  return result;
};
```

### Leaderboard Integration
- Scores automatically appear in global leaderboards
- Player stats updated in real-time
- Achievement tracking for milestones

## 📊 Performance Metrics
