## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

```
Player Workflow:
──────────────

1. APPROVE ONCE (for all games):
   Player → GamePaymentHandler.approve_for_games(token, amount)

2. PLAY ANY GAME:
   Player → ColorMatchGameV3.start_game(token)
          ↓
          ├─→ GamePaymentHandler.charge_game_fee()
          │   ├─→ 10% → house_fees
          │   ├─→ 5% → AirdropFundsV3.receive_fee_share()
          │   └─→ 85% → PredictionMarketV3.receive_fee_share()
          ↓
          Returns: session_id (u256) ← NO EVENT PARSING NEEDED!

3. SUBMIT SCORE:
   Player → ColorMatchGameV3.submit_score(session_id, score, data)
          ↓
          └─→ LeaderboardManager.add_score()
          ↓
          Returns: true/false

4. VIEW LEADERBOARD:
   Anyone → ColorMatchGameV3.get_leaderboard(limit)
          ↓
          └─→ LeaderboardManager.get_top_scores()
          ↓
          Returns: Array<LeaderboardEntry>
```

## 🎯 Key V3 Improvements Over V2

| Feature | V2 | V3 |
|---------|----|----|
| **Payment** | Per-game approval required | Single approval for ALL games |
| **Session ID** | Must parse from events | Returned directly from start_game() |
| **Interfaces** | Inconsistent across games | Fully standardized IGameV3 pattern |
| **Leaderboards** | Embedded in each game | Centralized LeaderboardManager |
| **Fee Distribution** | Manual, hardcoded | Automatic via GamePaymentHandler |
| **Airdrop Integration** | Manual calls | Automatic fee collection |
| **Prediction Market** | Separate integration | Automatic fee collection |
| **Testing** | Limited | Ready for comprehensive suite |
| **ABI Control** | Drift issues discovered | Versioned, standardized |
| **Code Reuse** | Duplication | Modular, shared components |

### Post-Deployment Configuration:
```typescript
// Authorize GamePaymentHandler to deposit in AirdropFunds
airdropFunds.add_authorized_depositor(paymentHandlerAddress)

// Authorize GamePaymentHandler to deposit in PredictionMarket
predictionMarket.add_authorized_depositor(paymentHandlerAddress)

// Authorize games in GamePaymentHandler
paymentHandler.authorize_game(colorMatchAddress)
paymentHandler.authorize_game(speedMatchAddress)
paymentHandler.authorize_game(memoryBlitzAddress)

// Authorize games to create markets in PredictionMarket
predictionMarket.add_authorized_creator(colorMatchAddress)
predictionMarket.add_authorized_creator(speedMatchAddress)
predictionMarket.add_authorized_creator(memoryBlitzAddress)

// Set game fees (example: 0.01 STRK per game)
paymentHandler.set_game_fee(strkTokenAddress, 10000000000000000) // 0.01 STRK
```

## 📝 Frontend Integration Guide

### Step 1: Single Approval (One Time)
```typescript
import { useScaffoldWriteContract } from "~~/hooks/scaffold-stark";

// Approve large amount once for all games
const { sendAsync: approve } = useScaffoldWriteContract({
  contractName: "GamePaymentHandler",
  functionName: "approve_for_games",
});

// Approve 100 STRK for future games
await approve([strkTokenAddress, "100000000000000000000"]); // 100 STRK
```

### Step 2: Start Game (Any Game)
```typescript
const { sendAsync: startGame } = useScaffoldWriteContract({
  contractName: "ColorMatchGameV3", // or SpeedMatchGameV3, MemoryBlitzGameV3
  functionName: "start_game",
});

// Start game - returns session_id directly!
const result = await startGame([strkTokenAddress]);
const sessionId = result; // u256 - NO EVENT PARSING NEEDED!
```

### Step 3: Submit Score
```typescript
const { sendAsync: submitScore } = useScaffoldWriteContract({
  contractName: "ColorMatchGameV3",
  functionName: "submit_score",
});

// For ColorMatch
await submitScore([sessionId, score, colorMatches]);

// For SpeedMatch
await submitScore([sessionId, score, correctMatches, timeTaken]);

// For MemoryBlitz
await submitScore([sessionId, score, levelReached, sequenceLength]);
```

### Step 4: View Leaderboard
```typescript
const { data: leaderboard } = useScaffoldReadContract({
  contractName: "ColorMatchGameV3",
  functionName: "get_leaderboard",
  args: [10], // Top 10
});
```
