# 🚀 V3 Contracts - Ready for Devnet Deployment!

## ✅ What's Complete

### 1. **Complete V3 Contract Suite** (~3,200+ lines)
All contracts are implemented, compiled successfully, and pushed to `newcontracts` branch!

#### Core Infrastructure
- ✅ [common_types.cairo](packages/snfoundry/contracts/src/v3/common_types.cairo)
- ✅ [game_payment_handler.cairo](packages/snfoundry/contracts/src/v3/game_payment_handler.cairo)
- ✅ [leaderboard_manager_v3.cairo](packages/snfoundry/contracts/src/v3/leaderboard_manager_v3.cairo)
- ✅ [base_game_v3.cairo](packages/snfoundry/contracts/src/v3/base_game_v3.cairo)

#### Game Contracts
- ✅ [color_match_game_v3.cairo](packages/snfoundry/contracts/src/v3/color_match_game_v3.cairo)
- ✅ [speed_match_game_v3.cairo](packages/snfoundry/contracts/src/v3/speed_match_game_v3.cairo)
- ✅ [memory_blitz_game_v3.cairo](packages/snfoundry/contracts/src/v3/memory_blitz_game_v3.cairo)

#### Supporting Contracts
- ✅ [airdrop_funds_v3.cairo](packages/snfoundry/contracts/src/v3/airdrop_funds_v3.cairo)
- ✅ **[prediction_market_v3.cairo](packages/snfoundry/contracts/src/v3/prediction_market_v3.cairo)** 🆕 **WITH USER-CREATED MARKETS!**

### 2. **New Prediction Market Feature** 🎲

Based on your requirements, the prediction market now allows:

#### Who Can Create Markets?
- **Past round winners ONLY** (top 3 finishers)
- Players who finished 1st, 2nd, or 3rd in previous rounds

#### How It Works:
1. **Round Ends**: LeaderboardManager identifies top 3 winners
2. **Winners Registered**: `register_round_winner()` marks them as eligible
3. **Create Market**: Winner pays **1 STRK** to create market
4. **Make Prediction**: "Will I make top 3 in the next round?" (YES/NO)
5. **Others Bet**: Any user can bet on the winner's prediction
6. **Market Resolves**: After next round, based on actual leaderboard position
7. **Payouts**: Winners get proportional share of losing pool

#### Key Functions:
```cairo
// Called by LeaderboardManager
fn register_round_winner(game, round, position, player)

// Called by past winners (costs 1 STRK)
fn create_self_prediction_market(game, target_round, prediction, token) → market_id

// Anyone can bet
fn place_bet(market_id, prediction, token, amount) → bet_id

// Auto-resolve after round ends
fn resolve_market_from_leaderboard(market_id, player_final_position) → bool

// Winners claim payouts
fn claim_winnings(bet_id) → payout_amount

// Check eligibility
fn is_eligible_to_create(player) → bool
```

## 🎯 Next Steps - Ready for YOU!

### Step 1: Start Local Devnet

Following: https://scaffoldstark.com/docs/quick-start/environment

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start devnet
cd packages/snfoundry
yarn chain

# Devnet will start on http://127.0.0.1:5050
# Pre-funded test accounts will be available
```

### Step 2: Deploy V3 Contracts

Following: https://scaffoldstark.com/docs/deploying/deploy-smart-contracts

We need to create deployment scripts. You have two options:

#### Option A: Use Scaffold-Stark Deploy Scripts (Recommended)
```bash
# Create deploy script in packages/snfoundry/scripts-ts/
# Based on Scaffold-Stark patterns
```

#### Option B: Manual Deploy with sncast
```bash
# 1. Compile contracts
yarn compile

# 2. Declare contracts
sncast declare --contract-name AirdropFundsV3
sncast declare --contract-name PredictionMarketV3
# ... etc

# 3. Deploy contracts (in order)
# See DEVNET_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md for deployment order
```

### Step 3: Configure Contracts

After deployment, connect them:

```bash
# Authorize games in payment handler
paymentHandler.authorize_game(colorMatchAddress)
paymentHandler.authorize_game(speedMatchAddress)
paymentHandler.authorize_game(memoryBlitzAddress)

# Set game fees (0.01 STRK)
paymentHandler.set_game_fee(STRK_TOKEN, "10000000000000000")

# Authorize game contracts in prediction market
predictionMarket.authorize_game_contract(colorMatchAddress)
# ... etc
```

### Step 4: Test Complete Flow

```typescript
// 1. Approve tokens (once)
await paymentHandler.approve_for_games(STRK_TOKEN, "100000000000000000000"); // 100 STRK

// 2. Play 10 games
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  const sessionId = await colorMatch.start_game(STRK_TOKEN);
  await colorMatch.submit_score(sessionId, score, data);
}

// 3. End round (admin)
await leaderboardColorMatch.end_current_round();

// 4. Winner creates prediction market
const marketId = await predictionMarket.create_self_prediction_market(
  colorMatchAddress,
  2, // next round
  true // "I will make top 3"
);

// 5. Others bet
await predictionMarket.place_bet(marketId, true, STRK_TOKEN, "10000000000000000");

// 6. Play next round
// 7. End round
// 8. Market auto-resolves
// 9. Winners claim payouts
```

### Step 5: Update Frontend

```typescript
// Update deployedContracts.ts with devnet addresses
export default {
  31337: { // Devnet
    GamePaymentHandler: { address: "0x...", abi: [...] },
    ColorMatchGameV3: { address: "0x...", abi: [...] },
    // ... all contracts
  }
}
```

## 📊 Architecture Overview

```
Player Flow:
────────────

1. Approve tokens ONCE → GamePaymentHandler
   ↓
2. Play games (0.01 STRK each)
   ├→ 10% House
   ├→ 5% Airdrop
   └→ 85% stays in game prize pool
   ↓
3. Round ends (10 games)
   ↓
4. Top 3 winners identified
   ├→ Registered in PredictionMarket
   └→ Can now create markets
   ↓
5. Winner creates market (1 STRK)
   "Will I make top 3 next round?"
   ↓
6. Users bet on market
   ├→ YES pool
   └→ NO pool
   ↓
7. Next round plays out
   ↓
8. Round ends
   ├→ Market resolves based on leaderboard
   └→ Winners get proportional payouts
   ↓
9. Repeat!
```

## 📝 Important Notes

### What's Different from V2:
1. **Single Approval**: Approve once, play forever (vs per-game approval)
2. **Direct Returns**: session_id returned directly (vs event parsing)
3. **Standardized**: All games use same interface
4. **User Markets**: Winners create their own markets (NEW!)
5. **Auto-Resolution**: Markets resolve from leaderboard (automatic)

### Game Fees vs Prediction Fees:
- **Playing games**: 0.01 STRK (goes to prize pool + house + airdrop)
- **Creating markets**: 1 STRK (only for past winners)
- **Betting on markets**: Any amount (5% house fee)

### Round System:
- Default: 10 games per round
- Configurable per game contract
- Winners = top 3 positions
- Markets = predict performance in NEXT round

## 🎉 You're Ready!

Everything is implemented, compiled, documented, and pushed to GitHub!

**What you need to do:**
1. Start devnet: `yarn chain`
2. Deploy contracts (create deployment script or use sncast)
3. Test the flow
4. Update frontend
